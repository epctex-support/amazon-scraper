## Input
Either start with a keyword or specific store URLs to your research.

üí°When you want to scrape over a specific list URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you start with a keyword, and you want to localize your search, you can choose a specific Amazon domain, and further localize it by entering a postal code.

You can limit the number of output results by either writing a number for number of listing items or list end page. Also, if you want to scrape product reviews too, don‚Äôt forget to switch it on, and limit the comments page if you want to.

üí°If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the *endPage* as 1.

üí°With the last approach that is explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the *endPage* parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

It is recommended to keep the other options as default.

### Compute Unit Consumption
The actor is optimized to run blazing fast and scrape as many items as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all the detailed requests. If the actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes with ~0.02-0.04 compute units.

### Bugs, fixes, updates, and changelog
This scraper is under active development. If you have any feature requests you can create an issue from [here](https://github.com/epctex/amazon-scraper/issues).

## During the Run
During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified. When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

### Amazon Export
During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Amazon actor.

	"description": "By all measurements my dog should have been a large but a large was way too big.  Medium fit a lot better but the front neck area is still too loose by just a bit.  With that said if they had a small it would definitely not fit her torso. An optional lower half that is more adjustable would be great.Sizing problems aside it's a really good looking vest. I like the number and spacing of the attachment points as well as the elastic on top. I use it to store my dogs poop tube (available on Amazon) so she can carry her own poop.  It looks well build but as my dog is slightly reactive I'm not going to trust the leash attachment point, that's my dog's problem and not the product though.",
